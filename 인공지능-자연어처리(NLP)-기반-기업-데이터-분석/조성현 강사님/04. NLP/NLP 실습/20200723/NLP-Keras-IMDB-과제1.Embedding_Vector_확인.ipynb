            "* after dark my sweet is a great modern noir filled with * characters dirt * and of course * characters it seems that most of the truly great * of the last two or three decades have taken place in the south where the men * and the ladies * * too why because it's * and because everyone looks better wet at least the men do * women leave me * br br anyway there might be some spoilers in here br br this film is a wonderful example of everything a noir should be steady pacing though some with attention * refer to it as * clearly and * drawn though not simple characters and tons of atmosphere noir if anything is about * and attitudes that's why the great ones are not * by your traditional * of * acting look at * * hurt and nicholson they and their characters were anything but real but they had style and * and in a crime movie that's exactly what you want or quickly paced adventures again all great * seem to be on slow burn like a * great * create an environment and you just * it with the characters for a couple hours br br after dark my sweet let's you do that and it let's you enjoy the company of some very interesting and complex characters uncle bud and * are intriguing never allowing the audience to know what really makes them * and * and * i love bruce * by the way are pitch perfect * especially see previous comment they take the basic * of a character and give them depth and * our * br br the story itself is also interesting * better plots in the world of noir hardly any mystery here mostly it's suspense but this one is solid if anything the simply * plot has more to do with jim * writing than anything else with thompson plots are almost secondary he * the * tales of * and * for * stories with stronger more confusing characters look at a novel like the killer inside me and and you'll see right away from the title what it's all about when it comes to thompson it's not what it's about it's how it's about it to quote roger * so really the relatively simple plot of a * is not the point and if you don't like it well the jokes on you br br why this is an * movie rather than a * one is because of the female lead she's not bad per * but she's not * * or * * see the adaptation of jim * the * if you don't know what i'm talking about besides it's a better movie and you should start there for contemporary noir it's the best of the 1990s and challenges blood simple for the title of best since * she simply doesn't have the * or the looks for that matter and though she and * have some chemistry i don't have it with her so there\n",
